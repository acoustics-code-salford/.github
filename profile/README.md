# Welcome
Welcome to the University of Salford Acoustics Code Repositories. This project is intended for sharing code within the Acoustics department as well as publicly hosting code associated with research.

If you are a member of staff or student and want to become a collaborator please email [acoustics-code@salford.ac.uk](mailto:acoustics-code@salford.ac.uk)

## Guidelines for contributors

If you'd like to host code here please keep the following in mind when preparing your repositories:

### Basic documentation
We'd like this to be a space for collaboration on projects. Please try to make sure that you have a <code>README.md</code> file in the root directory explaining what your code does and how it should be used. You don't need to comment every line but try to keep in mind that other people will want to know how to use your projects.

### Licenses
It will be best if you can include a license (GitHub provides a few when creating repos) even if its the most permissive, especially if your code is public facing.

### No big files/data
Github limits file sizes to 100MB and your projects won't upload if you try to include one and once something is commited it can be a pain to undo it! Be careful what you commit and try to only include code here. Audio, data, neural net weights and other big files should be stored elsewhere. 

### Try to work with branching

The main branch should be just for working code. Think of it like a 'release'. If you're developing/experimenting, consider making branches for this and pull them into the main branch when they're ready.

### Think about who will see your code

Remember that <b>public</b> means <i>public to the world</i>; <b>private</b> means <i>people in this organization can still see it</i> â€“ any code hosted should comply with confidentiality agreements/NDAs
